    CONTRACT TERMINATION CLAUSE
    
    Section 1.1 - Termination Rights
    Either party may terminate this agreement upon thirty (30) days written notice if the other party materially breaches any provision of this contract. The breaching party shall have fifteen (15) days to cure such breach after receiving written notice.

    Section 1.3 - Effect of Termination
    Upon termination, all rights and obligations shall cease except for those provisions that by their nature survive termination, including but not limited to confidentiality obligations, indemnification provisions, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
    
    INDEMNIFICATION CLAUSE
    
    Section 2.1 - General Indemnification
    Each party shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the other party from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs, and expenses arising out of or relating to the indemnifying party's breach of this agreement or violation of applicable law.
    
    Section 2.2 - Limitation of Liability
    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, neither party's liability shall exceed the total amount paid under this agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. This limitation shall not apply to breaches of confidentiality or indemnification obligations.
